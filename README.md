## ‚ú® Introduction

OpenStock is a modern stock market app powered by Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, Better Auth for authentication, MongoDB for persistence, Finnhub for market data, and TradingView widgets for charts and market views.

## üåç Open Dev Society Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls. Where tools are locked in subscriptions. Where information is twisted by bias. Where newcomers are told they‚Äôre not ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to build.

We believe there‚Äôs a better way.

- Our Belief: Technology should belong to everyone. Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible. Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.
- Our Mission: Build free, open-source projects that make a real difference:
    - Tools that professionals and students can use without barriers.
    - Knowledge platforms where learning is free, forever.
    - Communities where every beginner is guided, not judged.
    - Resources that run on trust, not profit.
- Our Promise: We will never lock knowledge. We will never charge for access. We will never trade trust for money. We run on transparency, donations, and the strength of our community.
- Our Call: If you‚Äôve ever felt you didn‚Äôt belong, struggled to find free resources, or wanted to build something meaningful ‚Äî you belong here.

Because the future belongs to those who build it openly.

## ü§∏ Quick Start

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm or npm
- MongoDB connection string (MongoDB Atlas or local via Docker Compose)
- Finnhub API key (free tier supported; real-time may require paid)
- Gmail account for email (or update Nodemailer transport)
- Optional: Google Gemini API key (for AI-generated welcome intros)

Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-Dev-Society/OpenStock.git
cd OpenStock

# choose one:
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

Configure environment
- Create a `.env` file (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
- Verify DB connectivity:
```bash
pnpm test:db
# or
npm run test:db
```

Run development
```bash
# Next.js dev (Turbopack)
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Run Inngest locally (workflows, cron, AI)
```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

Build & start (production)
```bash
pnpm build && pnpm start
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## üê≥ Docker Setup

You can run OpenStock and MongoDB easily with Docker Compose.

1) Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

2) docker-compose.yml includes two services:
- openstock (this app)
- mongodb (MongoDB database with a persistent volume)

3) Create your `.env` (see examples below). For the Docker setup, use a local connection string like:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/openstock?authSource=admin
```

4) Start the stack:
```bash
# from the repository root
docker compose up -d --build
```

5) Access the app:
- App: http://localhost:3000
- MongoDB is available inside the Docker network at host mongodb:27017

Notes
- The app service depends_on the mongodb service.
- Credentials are defined in Compose for the MongoDB root user; authSource=admin is required on the connection string for root.
- Data persists across restarts via the docker volume.

Optional: Example MongoDB service definition used in this project:
```yaml
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

## üöÄ Deploying to Netlify

Netlify can build the project without extra tweaks thanks to the included `netlify.toml`. Follow this checklist to enable one-click deployments:

1. **Prepare the repository**
   - Fork this repo or push it to your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
   - Ensure the default branch contains your configuration files and the latest code.
2. **Create a Netlify site**
   - Log into [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and choose **Add new site ‚Üí Import an existing project**.
   - Connect the repository; Netlify auto-detects the build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`.next`) from `netlify.toml`.
   - The official `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` is installed automatically during each build.
3. **Set environment variables**
   - In **Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables**, add the same keys you use locally (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details).
   - Minimum production-ready values:

      | Variable | Purpose |
      | --- | --- |
      | `MONGODB_URI` | Connection string for your MongoDB deployment (Atlas or dedicated cluster). |
      | `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Secret string for Better Auth session encryption. |
      | `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Public site URL (e.g. `https://your-site.netlify.app`). |
      | `FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Server-side Finnhub market data key. |
      | `NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY` | Optional browser-exposed Finnhub key if client requests need it. |
      | `FINNHUB_BASE_URL` | Default `https://finnhub.io/api/v1`; override only if you proxy requests. |
      | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | (Optional) Enables AI-powered emails triggered through Inngest. |
      | `NODEMAILER_EMAIL` / `NODEMAILER_PASSWORD` | SMTP credentials for transactional email delivery. |
4. **Trigger the first deploy**
   - Click **Deploy site**. Netlify runs `npm run build`, emits serverless functions for API routes/Server Actions, and serves assets from `.next`.
   - Subsequent pushes to the tracked branch deploy automatically.
5. **Local parity (optional)**
   - Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and run `netlify dev` to emulate Netlify Functions locally for QA parity.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For cron jobs or background workflows (Inngest), continue configuring them with the provider dashboards; Netlify focuses on request-driven functions.

## üîê Environment Variables

Create `.env` at the project root. Choose either a hosted MongoDB (Atlas) URI or the local Docker URI.

Hosted (MongoDB Atlas):
```env
# Core
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Finnhub
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
# Optional client-exposed variant if needed by client code:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=
FINNHUB_BASE_URL=https://finnhub.io/api/v1

# Inngest AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Email (Nodemailer via Gmail; consider App Passwords if 2FA)
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=youraddress@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

Local (Docker Compose) MongoDB:
```env
# Core
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (Docker)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/openstock?authSource=admin

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Finnhub
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=
FINNHUB_BASE_URL=https://finnhub.io/api/v1

# Inngest AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Email (Nodemailer via Gmail; consider App Passwords if 2FA)
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=youraddress@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

Notes
- Keep private keys server-side whenever possible.
- If using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, remember they are exposed to the browser.
- In production, prefer a dedicated SMTP provider over a personal Gmail.
- Do not hardcode secrets in the Dockerfile; use `.env` and Compose.
