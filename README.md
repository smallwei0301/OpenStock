## ✨ Introduction

OpenStock is a modern stock market app powered by Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, Better Auth for authentication, MongoDB for persistence, Finnhub for market data, and TradingView widgets for charts and market views.

## 🌍 Open Dev Society Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls. Where tools are locked in subscriptions. Where information is twisted by bias. Where newcomers are told they’re not “good enough” to build.

We believe there’s a better way.

- Our Belief: Technology should belong to everyone. Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible. Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.
- Our Mission: Build free, open-source projects that make a real difference:
    - Tools that professionals and students can use without barriers.
    - Knowledge platforms where learning is free, forever.
    - Communities where every beginner is guided, not judged.
    - Resources that run on trust, not profit.
- Our Promise: We will never lock knowledge. We will never charge for access. We will never trade trust for money. We run on transparency, donations, and the strength of our community.
- Our Call: If you’ve ever felt you didn’t belong, struggled to find free resources, or wanted to build something meaningful — you belong here.

Because the future belongs to those who build it openly.

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify <a name="deploy-to-netlify"></a>

One-click deploy (replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub handle):

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/OpenStock)

### Why it works

- `netlify.toml` defines the build, runtime, and Next.js plugin configuration required for ISR, Server Actions, and middleware to run on Netlify Functions.
- Critical server-side packages (`mongodb`, `mongoose`, `nodemailer`) are pre-bundled, and `LAZYBACKTEST_VERSION` tracks deployment-ready revisions.
- `.env.example` enumerates every secret the platform expects so you can copy values directly into Netlify UI.

### Manual setup steps

1. **Fork or clone** this repository into your own GitHub organization to ensure you control updates.
2. **Create a new Netlify site** and pick “Import from Git”. Choose your fork and the main branch (or whichever branch you want to deploy).
3. Netlify auto-detects the build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`.next`) from `netlify.toml`; no manual overrides needed.
4. **Add environment variables** in Netlify → Site Configuration → Environment variables. Use `.env.example` as the canonical reference. At minimum configure:
   - `MONGODB_URI` pointing to MongoDB Atlas (allow Netlify IP ranges),
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (a long random string) and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (your Netlify domain),
   - `FINNHUB_API_KEY` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY` if exposing client-side),
   - Email credentials (`NODEMAILER_EMAIL`, `NODEMAILER_PASSWORD`), and any optional automation keys.
5. **Trigger “Deploy site”**. Netlify installs dependencies, runs the Next.js build with the official `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, and provisions edge/serverless functions automatically.
6. **Verify runtime behaviour**:
   - Visit `/sign-in` to create an account and ensure Better Auth cookies are issued.
   - Add watchlist entries to confirm MongoDB writes succeed.
   - Inspect the Netlify Functions log for `connectToDatabase` messages to confirm connection reuse.

### Post-deployment recommendations

- Enable [Netlify Environment Variables](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/) scopes for “Production” and “Preview” to keep secrets separated.
- Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your final domain (custom domain or `*.netlify.app`).
- Configure background jobs (Inngest) with production keys only after validating local development flows.
- Update `LAZYBACKTEST_VERSION` whenever you change deployment-critical files so teammates know which bundle is live.

## 🐳 Docker Setup

You can run OpenStock and MongoDB easily with Docker Compose.

1) Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

2) docker-compose.yml includes two services:
- openstock (this app)
- mongodb (MongoDB database with a persistent volume)

3) Create your `.env` (see examples below). For the Docker setup, use a local connection string like:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/openstock?authSource=admin
```

4) Start the stack:
```bash
# from the repository root
docker compose up -d --build
```

5) Access the app:
- App: http://localhost:3000
- MongoDB is available inside the Docker network at host mongodb:27017

Notes
- The app service depends_on the mongodb service.
- Credentials are defined in Compose for the MongoDB root user; authSource=admin is required on the connection string for root.
- Data persists across restarts via the docker volume.

Optional: Example MongoDB service definition used in this project:
```yaml
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongosh", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env` at the project root. Choose either a hosted MongoDB (Atlas) URI or the local Docker URI.

Hosted (MongoDB Atlas):
```env
# Core
LAZYBACKTEST_VERSION=LB-NETLIFY-20250307
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (Atlas)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Finnhub
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
# Optional client-exposed variant if needed by client code:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=
FINNHUB_BASE_URL=https://finnhub.io/api/v1

# Inngest AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Email (Nodemailer via Gmail; consider App Passwords if 2FA)
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=youraddress@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

Local (Docker Compose) MongoDB:
```env
# Core
LAZYBACKTEST_VERSION=LB-NETLIFY-20250307
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (Docker)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongodb:27017/openstock?authSource=admin

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Finnhub
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=
FINNHUB_BASE_URL=https://finnhub.io/api/v1

# Inngest AI (Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Email (Nodemailer via Gmail; consider App Passwords if 2FA)
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=youraddress@gmail.com
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

Notes
- Keep private keys server-side whenever possible.
- If using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, remember they are exposed to the browser.
- In production, prefer a dedicated SMTP provider over a personal Gmail.
- Do not hardcode secrets in the Dockerfile; use `.env` and Compose.
- Update `LAZYBACKTEST_VERSION` whenever you change deployment-related configuration so Netlify builds stay traceable.
